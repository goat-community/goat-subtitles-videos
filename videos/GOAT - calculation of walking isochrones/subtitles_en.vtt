00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Then you have to zoom in to the area where you want to calculate the walking isochrone.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
This window shows the number of people that can be reached in the selected traveltime.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
By clicking on the additional layer and choosing default road network the network will be visible.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
The color of the network indicates the traveltime that is needed to reach a certain link.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
You can toggle individual isochrones or all at once.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
GOAT offers the possibility to download the calculated isochrones as GeoJson or Shapefile.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
